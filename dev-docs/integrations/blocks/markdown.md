# Working with Markdown

Integration blocks can be configured to leverage custom formatting and parsing of markdown content.

### As a code block

In some cases (ex: with our official Mermaid block), integrations might want to format custom blocks as code-blocks in Markdown.

In the `gitbook-manifest.yaml`, define the `markdown` property for the a block:

<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="lang-yaml">blocks:
    - id: block-name
      title: My custom block
<strong>      markdown:
</strong>        codeblock: blocksyntax
<strong>        body: content
</strong></code></pre>

In this scenario, a block with the properties `{ "content": "something" }` will be formatted as:

````
```blocksyntax
something
```
````

In the scenario where the block also has other properties, those will be set on the codeblock. For example with a block having the properties `{ "content": "something", "propA": "A" }`

````
```blocksyntax propA="A"
something
```
````
