\*_The open-source tool for building high-quality datasets and computer vision models_\_

Nothing hinders the success of machine learning systems more than poor quality\
data. And without the right tools, improving a model can be time-consuming and\
inefficient.

FiftyOne supercharges your machine learning workflows by enabling you to\
visualize datasets and interpret models faster and more effectively.

Improving data quality and understanding your model's failure modes are the\
most impactful ways to boost the performance of your model.

FiftyOne provides the building blocks for optimizing your dataset analysis\
pipeline. Use it to get hands-on with your data, including visualizing complex\
labels, evaluating your models, exploring scenarios of interest, identifying\
failure modes, finding annotation mistakes, and much more!

#### Core Concepts

### FiftyOne Library

FiftyOne's core library provides a structured yet dynamic representation to\
explore your datasets. You can efficiently query and manipulate your dataset by\
adding custom tags, model predictions and more.

<a href="../integrations/contentkit/interactivity.md" class="button primary">Explore the library</a>

```python\
:linenos:\
import fiftyone as fo\
dataset = fo.Dataset("my_dataset")\
sample = fo.Sample(filepath="/path/to/image.png")\
sample.tags.append("train")\
sample["custom_field"] = 51\
dataset.add_sample(sample)\
view = dataset.match_tags("train").sort_by("custom_field").limit(10)\
for sample in view:\
print(sample)\
```

{% hint style="info" %}
\
\_\_Note:\_\*\
FiftyOne is designed to be lightweight and flexible, making it easy to load\
your datasets. FiftyOne supports loading datasets in a variety of common\
formats out-of-the-box, and it also provides the extensibility to load\
datasets in custom formats.\\
{% endhint %}

```
Check out :doc:`loading datasets <user_guide/dataset_creation/index>` to see\
how to load your data into FiftyOne.
```

### FiftyOne App

The FiftyOne App is a graphical user interface that makes it easy to explore\
and rapidly gain intuition into your datasets. You can visualize labels like\
bounding boxes and segmentations overlaid on the samples; sort, query and\
slice your dataset into any subset of interest; and more.

<a href="../integrations/contentkit/interactivity.md" class="button primary">See more of the App</a>

### FiftyOne Brain

The FiftyOne Brain is a library of powerful machine learning-powered\
capabilities that provide insights into your datasets and recommend ways to\
modify your datasets that will lead to measurably better performance of your\
models.

<a href="../integrations/contentkit/interactivity.md" class="button primary">Learn more about the Brain</a>

```python\
:linenos:\
import fiftyone.brain as fob\
fob.compute_uniqueness(dataset)\
rank_view = dataset.sort_by("uniqueness")\
```

### FiftyOne Plugins

FiftyOne provides a powerful plugin framework that allows for extending and\
customizing the functionality of the tool to suit your specific needs.

With plugins, you can add new functionality to the FiftyOne App, create\
integrations with other tools and APIs, render custom panels, and add custom\
buttons to menus.

With :ref:`FiftyOne Enterprise <enterprise-delegated-operations>`, you can even write\
plugins that allow users to execute long-running tasks from within the App that\
run on a connected compute cluster.

<a href="../integrations/contentkit/interactivity.md" class="button primary">Install some plugins!</a>

### Dataset Zoo

The FiftyOne Dataset Zoo provides a powerful interface for downloading datasets\
and loading them into FiftyOne.

It provides native access to dozens of popular benchmark datasets, and it als\
supports downloading arbitrary public or private datasets whose\
download/preparation methods are provided via GitHub repositories or URLs.

<a href="../integrations/contentkit/interactivity.md" class="button primary">Check out the Dataset Zoo</a>

```python\
:linenos:\
import fiftyone as fo\
import fiftyone.zoo as foz\
dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("coco-2017", split="validation")\
session = fo.launch_app(dataset)\
```

![dataset-zoo](images/dataset_zoo_coco_2017.png)

### Model Zoo

The FiftyOne Model Zoo provides a powerful interface for downloading models and\
applying them to your FiftyOne datasets.

It provides native access to hundreds of pre-trained models, and it also\
supports downloading arbitrary public or private models whose definitions are\
provided via GitHub repositories or URLs.

<a href="../integrations/contentkit/interactivity.md" class="button primary">Check out the Model Zoo</a>

```python\
:linenos:\
import fiftyone as fo\
import fiftyone.zoo as foz\
dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset(\
"coco-2017",\
split="validation",\
max_samples=50,\
shuffle=True,\
)
model = foz.load_zoo_model(\
"clip-vit-base32-torch",\
text_prompt="A photo of a",\
classes=["person", "dog", "cat", "bird", "car", "tree", "chair"],\
)
dataset.apply_model(model, label_field="zero_shot_predictions")\
session = fo.launch_app(dataset)\
```
