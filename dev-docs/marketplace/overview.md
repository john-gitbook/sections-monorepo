# Overview

When using GitBook, you're able to search through a [library of public integrations](https://www.gitbook.com/integrations) you can use to enhance the sites and projects you're working on.

From embedded sites, to analytic tools, to enhanced ways to display data, our library of integrations is always growing.&#x20;

You're able to access any public integration from our [website](https://www.gitbook.com/integrations), or directly in the app when writing a new page.

GitBook's marketplace contains integrations built or verified by GitBook. In order to add your app to GitBook's marketplace, you'll need to go through our [app submission process](submit-your-app-for-review.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
You are still able to share any app or integration you build in GitBook with others, without it publicly being listed in GitBook's marketplace.&#x20;

See the [publishing section](broken-reference) to learn more.

Interested in an integration, but don't have the resources to build it? Feel free to [submit an integration request](https://survey.refiner.io/e61q1m-dp057m)!&#x20;
