# Public publishing

If you created your docs for a public audience, you can publish it on the web. Spaces that you publish on the web can be [indexed by search engines](../seo.md) and will be available to anyone. If you don’t want your content to be indexed by search engines, you can disable that too — read more about that [below](public-publishing.md#publish-as-unlisted).

However you publish your content, you’ll still retain control over who can _edit_ your content. And only your primary content branch will be published, so any [change requests](../../collaboration/change-requests.md) will remain private until merged.

### Publish as public

To publish your docs publicly on the web head to the docs site you want to publish, click **Publish** button, and choose the **Public** option.

### **Publish without search engine indexing**

By default, your site will be indexed by search engines. You can alternatively choose to disable this — meaning the docs are still available to everyone on the web, but they _won’t_ be indexed by search engines such as Google.

They will still be accessible to anyone with a the link to your documentation. Docs sites that aren’t indexed can be particularly helpful if you want to publish a beta version of your docs, or do large-scale user testing without impacting your SEO with potentially duplicate content.
