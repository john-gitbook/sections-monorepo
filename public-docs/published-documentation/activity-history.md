# Version control

You can easily monitor all the changes people have made to your content using to the **Version history** side panel.

### Version history <a href="#see-the-activity-of-a-specific-draft" id="see-the-activity-of-a-specific-draft"></a>

In the Version history of a space, you can see a list of all the actions that changed the content within it. These include:

* When someone made [live edits](../editing-content/live-edits.md) to the space.
* When someone merged a [change request](../collaboration/change-requests.md).
* When someone performed a [Git Sync](../integrations/git-sync/) operation.

### Viewing historical versions of content

To view past versions of your content and see the changes that were made, click the **Version history** <picture><source srcset="../.gitbook/assets/Revision history dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Revision history light.png" alt="" data-size="line"></picture> button from the space’s **Actions menu** <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Actions menu.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the top-right corner.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions:** Only users with **admin**, **creator**, **reviewer** and **editor** permissions can view the version history for a space.
{% endhint %}

Click on any item in the list to see how your content looked at the point this change was made. This is very similar to how you view [change requests](../collaboration/change-requests.md).

### Show changes

When you are viewing an old version of your content, you can choose to highlight the differences between the old and current content — similar to [diff view in a change request](../collaboration/change-requests.md#diff-mode).

To enable or disable this, use the **Show changes** toggle at the bottom of the **Version history** side panel.

With show changes enabled, content that has changed will be highlighted by an icon on the left of its content block.

### Rolling back to a previous version

Rolling back allows you to revert a space’s content to the way it was at a previous point in time. This is helpful if you’ve accidentally made a breaking change or deleted content and need to quickly get back to a previous version of the space.

To roll back to a previous version of your space, hover over the version in the side panel, click the **Actions button** <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Actions menu.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and select **Rollback**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions:** Only users with **admin**, **creator** and **reviewer** permissions can roll back to a previous version.
{% endhint %}
