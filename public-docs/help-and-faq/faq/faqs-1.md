### Does GitBook have a find and replace feature?

While there isn't a way to globally find and replace all instances of a term across your GitBook content, if you use our git sync feature, you can more easily find all instances of a word and replace it. Once you merge these updates in GitHub or GitLab, the changes will be synced and reflected in your content.
