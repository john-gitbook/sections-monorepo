# Spaces

A space is a project that lets you work on a collection of related pages. Imagine it as a virtual book where you can start writing pages individually or collaborate asynchronously with your team members.

### Create a space

Click the **+** button next to the **Spaces** header in the sidebar and choose **New space** to create a new space. You can also create a new space from a [collection](what-is-a-collection.md).

### Duplicate a space

To duplicate a space, open that space's **Action menu** <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Actions menu.png" alt="Three vertical dots" data-size="line"> in the sidebar and select **Duplicate**.

Duplicating a space will create a copy of the source space, in the same location (organization, collection, sub-collection, etc.).

### Move a space

You can move a space by opening the space’s **Action menu** <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Actions menu.png" alt="Three vertical dots" data-size="line"> in the sidebar, selecting **Move space to…** and choosing a destination. Alternatively, you can drag and drop spaces in the sidebar to move or reorder them.\

You can move spaces between collections or even organizations, as long as you have an [admin role](../../account-management/member-management/roles.md) in both.

### Delete a space

You can delete a space by opening the space’s **Action menu** <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Actions menu.png" alt="Three vertical dots" data-size="line"> in the sidebar and selecting **Delete**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Deleted spaces can be restored from the Trash for up to 7 days**. After this, they will be permanently deleted.
{% endhint %}
