# Drawings

You can create a drawing or sketch directly though GitBook using the integrated [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) editor, then add it right into your GitBook page.

To create a drawing, press `/` on an empty line to bring up the insert palette and choose **Drawing**. This will open a popover with Excalidraw tools — simply close the popover when you’re done and your diagram will appear on your GitBook page.

GitBook stores drawings as special SVG files in the space. Those files have an extension of `drawing.svg`.

### Draw with GitBook AI

{% hint style="warning" %}
GitBook AI is available as part of the Pro plan and Enterprise plan. To find out more, [visit our pricing page](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing).
{% endhint %}

When using drawing block, you can ask GitBook AI to generate an illustration by specifying a prompt. Simply type in a prompt and hit **Generate**, or choose one of the suggested prompts to get started.

Once GitBook AI has finished the drawing, you can double-click to open the full drawing palette and edit it however you like.

When editing a drawing, click the **Use AI to generate** button to bring up GitBook AI’s prompt editor again and generate a new drawing.
