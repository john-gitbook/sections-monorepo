  inline images and more.

# Paragraphs

A paragraph is the most basic content block you can use on GitBook. It’s exactly what it says — a paragraph of text.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can [add other inline content](../editing-content/inline.md) to your paragraph, such as emojis, images and Math & TeX. You can also [format your paragraph text](../editing-content/formatting.md) using the context menu or keyboard shortcuts, or [using Markdown](../editing-content/markdown.md).
{% endhint %}

### Example of a paragraph

Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should “set opening paragraphs flush left.”

### Representation in Markdown

Because a paragraph block is just text, that’s how it’s represented in Markdown.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```markdown
Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, Robert Bringhurst states that we should “set opening paragraphs flush left.”
```
{% endcode %}
