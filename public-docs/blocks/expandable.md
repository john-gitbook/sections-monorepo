# Expandable sections

Expandable blocks are helpful in condensing what could otherwise be a lengthy paragraph. They are also great in step-by-step guides and FAQs.

### Example

<details>

<summary>Step 1: Start using expandable blocks</summary>

To add an expandable block hit `/` on an empty block, or click the `+` on the left of the editor, and select **Expandable**.

<summary>Step 2: Add content to your block</summary>

Once you’ve inserted an expandable block, you can add content to it — including lists and code blocks.

## Representation in Markdown

```markdown
# Expandable blocks

<details>

<summary>Expandable block</summary>



</details>
```

### Limitations

There are some limitations on which blocks you can create inside of an expandable block. You can check the full list by starting a new line in an expandable block and pressing `/` to bring up the insert palette.
