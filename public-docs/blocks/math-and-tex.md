# Math & TeX

You can use the mathTeX format to include mathematical formulae in your documentation. We offer this through the [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) library.

You can also add mathTeX [as inline content](../editing-content/inline.md#math-and-tex).

### Example of Math & TeX block

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}
$$

### Representation in Markdown

$$f(x) = x * e^{2 pi i \xi x}$$

```markdown
# Math and TeX block

$$f(x) = x * e^{2 pi i \xi x}$$
```
