# Quotes

Quotes are useful when you want to include something from another source.

Start a quote by typing `>` followed by pressing `Space` in an empty paragraph, or use the[ insert palette](./#inserting-a-new-content-block). You can also convert a paragraph block to a quote by highlighting the entire paragraph and hitting `>`.

### Example of a quote

> "No human ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and they are not the same human." — _Heraclitus_

### Representation in Markdown

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```markdown
> "No human ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and they are not the same human." — _Heraclitus_
```
{% endcode %}
