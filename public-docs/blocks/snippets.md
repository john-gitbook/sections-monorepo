# Snippets

Snippet blocks are a great way to reference a snippet in your content. Snippet blocks help make the link to your snippet stand out on the page compared to [an inline link](../editing-content/inline.md#relative-links).

You can only use snippet blocks for internal pages. If you add a snippet block to a page in a published space, the public documentation will show the block as a broken link.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** If you use a snippet block, but then [convert your snippet into a page](../snippets/snippets-beta.md#convert-a-snippet-to-a-page) in your documentation, your snippet block will still link back to the original snippet, which will be archived.
{% endhint %}
