# Member management

You can [invite and remove members](invite-members-to-your-organization.md) from your organization, manage members’ content access through [roles](roles.md), and manage [teams](teams.md) of members from the members’ page in your organization’s settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Permissions**

**Admins** can invite and remove members, change members’ roles, and manage teams. **Creators** can manage permissions at a content level (collection or space).\
**Team owners** can manage members of the team they have ownership of.
{% endhint %}

## Members & permissions

Shows each person’s role, last seen date, and [SSO](../sso-and-saml/sso-and-saml.md) status, if applicable. You’ll also see an overview of the [spaces](../../editor/content-structure/what-is-a-space.md) they can access and, if you’re on the Pro plan, how many [teams](teams.md) they’re part of.

Click the **Teams** or **Access** listings for any member to jump to a list of all those teams and spaces.

You can also click on any member to open their **individual member page**. Here, you can see more information about them, including their join date and active status.

Select the **Teams** and **Spaces** tabs to see a list of the [teams](teams.md) they’re a member of, and the spaces they have access to — as well as their access level for those specific spaces.
